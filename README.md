# Permission-Generator-Microservice

## A small microservice for generating permissions

### Getting Started

## Installing Packages

To install all the required packages, run:

```
npm install
```

## Running the local server

To run the local server, type

```
npm start
```

Incase you do not want to quit and restart the server upon making changes in code, use the **nodemon** module

## To install **nodemon module**,type:

```
npm i nodemon
```
This should automatically take care to restart the server incase you make changes.
